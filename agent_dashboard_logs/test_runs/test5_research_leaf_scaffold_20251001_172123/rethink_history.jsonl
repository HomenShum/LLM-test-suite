The agent must:\n\n1. PERCEPTION: Analyze the shirt's current state (spatial coordinates, fabric type, wrinkle severity)\n2. PLANNING: Determine optimal folding strategy based on current Folding Policy\n3. EXECUTION: Generate precise motor control commands for robotic manipulation\n4. VERIFICATION: Assess folding quality through perception feedback\n5. ADAPTATION: Update Folding Policy if the attempt fails\n\nEXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:\n- Use Web Research Agent \u2192 repurposed as Vision/Perception Agent (analyze shirt state)\n- Use Code Executor Agent \u2192 repurposed as Motor Control Agent (generate manipulation commands)\n- Use Validator Agent \u2192 repurposed as Perception Feedback Agent (verify folding quality)\n- Use Content Generator Agent \u2192 repurposed as Task Summary Agent (compile results)\n- IF folding fails: Trigger policy update with corrective constraints\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Shirt successfully folded (simulated) OR\n- Folding Policy Block updated with failure analysis and corrective constraints", "revert_point_id": "revert_0_Purpose_1759364483"}
