VERIFICATION: Assess folding quality through perception feedback\n5. ADAPTATION: Update Folding Policy if the attempt fails\n\nEXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:\n- Use Web Research Agent \u2192 repurposed as Vision/Perception Agent (analyze shirt state)\n- Use Code Executor Agent \u2192 repurposed as Motor Control Agent (generate manipulation commands)\n- Use Validator Agent \u2192 repurposed as Perception Feedback Agent (verify folding quality)\n- Use Content Generator Agent \u2192 repurposed as Task Summary Agent (compile results)\n- IF folding fails: Trigger policy update with corrective constraints\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Shirt successfully folded (simulated) OR\n- Folding Policy Block updated with failure analysis and corrective constraints", "version": 2, "last_modified_turn": 0, "modification_count": 1}, "Tool Guidelines": {"content": "FOLDING POLICY v1.0:\n- Locate shirt corners using edge detection\n- Fold along vertical centerline first\n- Apply 2N force for fabric manipulation\n- Verify fold alignment within 5mm tolerance\n- CONSTRAINT: Monitor for object slippage during manipulation", "version": 2, "last_modified_turn": 0, "modification_count": 1}}, "archival_entries": [], "statistics": {"total_retrievals": 0, "total_insertions": 0, "cache_hits": 0, "avg_retrieval_latency_ms": 0.0}}
