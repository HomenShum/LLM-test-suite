      "query": "high-resolution macro close-up images of metal and plastic surfaces, diffuse/cross-polarized lighting, focus-stacked, neutral background, with scale/ruler \u2014 professional product QC photography showing scratches, fine dents, discoloration, paint defects (>=20MP)",
      "rationale": "Macro, cross-polarized and focus-stacked captures maximize visibility of fine surface defects (micro-scratches, hairline cracks, subtle dents, color shifts). Including a scale/ruler ensures measurable defect sizing for quality rating.",
      "expected_results": "Sharp, high-resolution close-ups revealing micro-scratches, abrasion marks, small dents, edge chipping, paint runs or discoloration with size reference; minimal specular highlights so surface texture and color variations are clear.",

      "rationale": "Multi-angle inspection images reveal macroscopic defects: dents, warping, misaligned assemblies, missing parts or asymmetric discoloration. Controlled lighting and scale allow consistent visual quality assessment across whole object.",
      "expected_results": "Clear, consistent high-res images from multiple angles showing overall shape, dents, bends, panel gaps, misaligned seams, major scratches or surface anomalies with a size reference and even lighting.",

      "rationale": "Searching for specific manufacturing-flaw terminology (sink marks, flash, weld lines, orange-peel) returns images that exemplify common production defects and help train/compare defect signatures. Annotated examples speed identification and grading.",
      "expected_results": "Close-up images showing clear examples of specific manufacturing defects (e.g., mold flash, sink marks, weld beads, paint texture defects, corrosion pits) often with annotations or captions identifying the defect type; high clarity for feature recognition.",
