## 📊 Example Walkthrough

### **Scenario: Testing 4 Models on 10 VR Avatar Images**

**Analysis Setup:**
- Models: GPT-5 Vision, Gemini 2.5 Vision, Claude 4.5 Vision, Llama 3.2 Vision
- Images: 10 VR avatar screenshots
- Task: "Detect visual artifacts and rate quality"

**Synthesis Results:**

#### **Summary Metrics**
```
Total Images: 10
Models Tested: 4
Best Model: GPT-5 Vision
Avg Agreement: 82.3%
```

#### **Model Rankings**
```
Rank  Model                Overall Score  Avg Confidence  Detail Score
1     GPT-5 Vision         0.847          85.2%           0.623

3     Claude 4.5 Vision    0.798          79.8%           0.612
4     Llama 3.2 Vision     0.765          76.5%           0.534
```

**Interpretation:**
- GPT-5 Vision is the clear winner (highest overall score)
- All models have good confidence (>75%)
- GPT-5 and Claude have better detail scores

#### **Complementary Strengths**
```
GPT-5 Vision:
✅ High confidence predictions
✅ Detailed explanations

Gemini 2.5 Vision:
✅ Artifact detection
✅ Detailed explanations

Claude 4.5 Vision:
✅ High confidence predictions

Llama 3.2 Vision:
✅ Artifact detection
```

**Interpretation:**
- Use GPT-5 for general analysis (best overall)
- Use Gemini when artifact detection is critical
- Claude is good for confident predictions
- Llama is a budget option for artifact detection

#### **High-Priority Insights**

**🔴 Model Selection**
- **Insight:** GPT-5 Vision performed best overall
- **Action:** Use GPT-5 Vision as primary model for this task type

**🔴 Quality Control**
- **Insight:** 2 images have low confidence
- **Action:** Review these images manually: avatar_003.jpg, avatar_007.jpg

**Interpretation:**
- Switch to GPT-5 Vision for future VR avatar checks
- Manually inspect avatar_003.jpg and avatar_007.jpg for issues

#### **Medium-Priority Insights**

**🟡 Ensemble Strategy**
- **Insight:** Models have complementary strengths
- **Action:** Use ensemble approach: GPT-5 Vision for High confidence predictions, Gemini 2.5 Vision for Artifact detection

**Interpretation:**
- For critical checks, use both GPT-5 and Gemini
- GPT-5 for overall quality, Gemini for artifact detection
- This costs more but provides comprehensive coverage

#### **Agreement Analysis**
```
Mean Agreement: 82.3%
Std Dev: 0.087
Min Agreement: 68.5%

Pairwise Agreement:
GPT-5 ↔ Gemini:  87.2%
GPT-5 ↔ Claude:  85.1%
GPT-5 ↔ Llama:   78.9%
Gemini ↔ Claude: 84.3%
Gemini ↔ Llama:  79.6%
Claude ↔ Llama:  73.2%
```

**Interpretation:**
- High overall agreement (82.3%) = task is clear
- GPT-5 and Gemini agree most (87.2%)
- Claude and Llama agree least (73.2%)
- All pairs > 70% = reasonable consistency

#### **Prompt Optimization**

**Original Prompt:**
```
Detect visual artifacts and rate quality
```

**Improved Prompt for Llama 3.2 Vision:**
```
Detect visual artifacts and rate quality

Additional guidance:
- Be specific and confident in your analysis.
- Provide detailed explanations for your findings.
```

**Interpretation:**
- Llama needs more guidance for better results
- Other models are already performing well with original prompt
- Use improved prompt for next Llama run

#### **Visualizations**

**Agreement Heatmap:**
```
                GPT-5   Gemini  Claude  Llama
GPT-5           1.00    0.87    0.85    0.79
Gemini          0.87    1.00    0.84    0.80
Claude          0.85    0.84    1.00    0.73
Llama           0.79    0.80    0.73    1.00
```
- Green cells = High agreement
- GPT-5 ↔ Gemini is greenest (best agreement)
- Claude ↔ Llama is reddest (lowest agreement)

**Confidence Correlation:**
```
Pearson r = 0.68 (p = 0.031)
```
- Positive correlation = Higher confidence → Higher agreement
- Statistically significant (p < 0.05)
- Models are well-calibrated (not overconfident)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Use Synthesis for Every Analysis**

Don't just look at raw results - always check the Synthesis tab for:
- Clear winner
- Actionable insights
- Prompt improvements

### **Tip 2: Pay Attention to Agreement**

- **High agreement (>80%)**: Task is clear, single model is fine
- **Medium agreement (60-80%)**: Consider ensemble
- **Low agreement (<60%)**: Refine task description or use multiple models

### **Tip 3: Leverage Complementary Strengths**

Don't always use the "best" model - use the RIGHT model:
- **High confidence needed?** → GPT-5 or Claude
- **Artifact detection critical?** → Gemini or Llama
- **Budget constrained?** → Llama
- **Best overall?** → GPT-5

### **Tip 4: Iterate on Prompts**

1. Run analysis with original prompt
2. Check synthesis for prompt improvements
3. Use improved prompts for next run
4. Compare results
5. Repeat

### **Tip 5: Monitor Flagged Images**

Always review low-confidence images manually:
- They might be edge cases
- They might reveal model weaknesses
- They might indicate data quality issues

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Synthesis tab is empty**

**Solution:**
- Ensure analysis completed successfully
- Check that at least 2 models were tested
- Verify results have `model_results` field

### **Problem: Visualizations don't show**

**Solution:**
- Need at least 2 models for agreement heatmap
- Need at least 3 images for correlation plot
- Check browser console for errors

### **Problem: All insights are generic**

**Solution:**
- Run analysis on more images (5+ recommended)
- Use more diverse models
- Ensure task description is specific

### **Problem: Agreement is always 0%**

**Solution:**
- Check that models are analyzing the same images
- Verify confidence scores are being extracted
- Look for errors in model responses
